                <h2>What Changed my Mind</h2>
                <p>Even though am a professional fitter I have always wanted to learn new skills, also with the depreciating effect of Nigerian economy and naira against dollar negative effect their was a need for me to take immediate and drastic action to savage what I knew was a doom waiting to happen.
                <br><p>This are some the reasons why decided to change my career</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The physical demanding of the Job</li>
                    <li>Their were lots of profesional workers with litle opportuinities for them</li>
                    <li>The job isn't as lucrative as I thougth as people were been under paid badly</li>
                    <li>The hazadous nature of the job</li>
                    <li>Most fitting jobs are short term contracts</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After much consideration I took the bold step </p>
                <p>First of all in 2016 I did venture into forex trading which didn't go well as I lost 200 Dollars in the first two months reason being that trading is about prediction using graphs and past outcome something that I felt is based on luck.<br>In late 2019 I moved into betting spending close to a million naira seeting up a beeting shop which as at then wasn't was giving me low profit until covid-19 pandemic came and made it worse</p>
                <p>All this while that I was struggling I have a friend Chioma whom I met long time ago at one of the locations I worked a good soul on that matter, she is a software developer seeing how well she is  doing I developed a likeness for this skill. I stated making some reasearch in secret espercially what tools and skills I need to posses before embarking on this journey.<br>I reached out to her and with her advice and mentorship I am now learning web Developement</p>
                <p>This are my activities during the week on how i learn</p>
